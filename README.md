# _Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction_
# Overveiw 
This code demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for predicting the risk of cervical cancer. It performs data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

# Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Code Description

# Importing Libraries
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Numerical computing library.
matplotlib: Data visualization library.
seaborn: Data visualization library based on matplotlib.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

# Data Loading
The code loads the cervical cancer risk dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Preprocessing
Numeric and non-numeric columns are separated.
Missing values in numeric columns are filled with the mean and scaled using StandardScaler.
Missing values in non-numeric columns are filled with the most frequent value and encoded using OneHotEncoder.

# Model Training
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
The Random Forest Classifier is used as the classification model.

# Model Evaluation
Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to evaluate the model's performance.
Usage
Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
Copy the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
